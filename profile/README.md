# NearForm
## *Creating Digital Advantage* 

### Who are we? 

*At NearForm, we build brilliant digital products and develop digital capability.*

:computer: As a remote-first company, NearForm brings people together in highly-skilled teams spread out across 27 countries that collectively build digital solutions for global challenges. We are open and transparent, sharing thoughts, knowledge and ideas both with our teams and with our clients. 

:keyboard: We focus on fast delivery to mobile and web platforms by a single team from a single codebase. At NearForm, we are committed to growing the JavaScript ecosystem through contributions to Open Source projects, particularly within React.js & Node.js. 

### Our contributions to the open source community

:busts_in_silhouette: From our inception, our core belief has been that web technology and programming languages would enable us to solve real-world problems efficiently and quickly. This was true when we founded the company in 2012, and remains true to this day.

As part of our day-to-day activities, we contribute to Open Source, conduct research and create prototypes, and regularly publish Open Source code which we also use internally.

## :hourglass: Events

### NodeConf EU

We are the proud organisers of [NodeConf EU]([https://twitter.com/nodeconfremote](https://twitter.com/nodeconfeu)), and most recently, NodeConf Remote, a three-day conference providing a place for Node.js experts to come together every year and collaborate while discussing new developments.

In Ocotber 2022 NearForm welcomed the return of NodeConf as an in-person event in Ireland! NodeConf EU has rightly earned its reputation as the leading key Node.js event in Europe, bringing together the brilliant Node community in a relaxed environment catered to promoting the sharing of ideas.

During the 3 day conference, attendees hear from over 30 hand-picked speakers and have the opportunity to participate in a selection of workshops with top Node.js contributors.
